## Key Insights
- **Cycle of Anxiety**: The journey often loops back to the trigger stage due to ineffective coping and reluctance to seek help, perpetuating anxiety.
- **Barriers to Support**: Lack of awareness, stigma, and negative past experiences prevent students from accessing mental health resources.
- **Disconnected Coping**: Students rely on isolation or procrastination, which worsens anxiety, while positive strategies like exercise are underutilized due to time constraints.
- **External Pressures**: Family expectations and financial concerns amplify academic stress, making it harder for students to feel aligned with their studies.

## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Resource Awareness**: Launch a campus-wide campaign to promote mental health services, including posters, emails, and workshops.
2. **Improve Academic Clarity**: Faculty should provide clear expectations, timely feedback, and flexible deadlines to reduce stress.
3. **Foster Belonging**: Create student-led support groups or mentorship programs to address feelings of isolation and comparison.
4. **Accessible Coping Tools**: Offer bite-sized stress management resources (e.g., 5-minute mindfulness sessions) tailored to busy schedules.
5. **Destigmatize Help-Seeking**: Integrate mental health discussions into orientation and academic advising to normalize seeking support.
