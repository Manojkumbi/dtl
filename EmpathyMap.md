# Empathy Map: RVCE MCA Students Experiencing Academic Anxiety

## Persona: Typical MCA Student at RVCE
This empathy map represents a composite of MCA students at RVCE based on survey responses collected on June 17–18, 2025, regarding their experiences with anxiety in student life.

### Says
- "I feel overwhelmed by constant deadlines and academic overload."
- "I don’t know where to go for help with my anxiety."
- "The expectations of the faculty exceed what they’ve taught us."
- "I prefer to handle my stress myself."
- "I’m worried about failing or getting low grades."
- "I feel pressure from my family to succeed academically."

### Thinks
- "Am I good enough to meet these academic expectations?"
- "I’m not sure if I belong here or if I’m doing the right thing."
- "What if I can’t keep up with my peers?"
- "I don’t want others to know I’m struggling."
- "Will my future be secure, or am I wasting my time?"
- "I wish I understood what’s expected of me more clearly."

### Does
- Avoids or procrastinates on academic tasks.
- Talks to friends or family for support.
- Sleeps or isolates to cope with stress.
- Engages in hobbies or exercise to distract from anxiety.
- Uses campus resources (rarely, by a few).
- Compares academic performance with peers.

### Feels
- Overwhelmed: constant deadlines are suffocating.
- Anxious: racing thoughts and tight chest when facing academic tasks.
- Inadequate: feels like they’re not good enough compared to others.
- Isolated: struggles with a lack of belonging at university.
- Pressured: family and societal expectations weigh heavily.
- Uncertain: worried about future career prospects and academic success.

### Insights Across Quadrants
- **Juxtaposition**: Students often say they prefer to handle stress independently but feel overwhelmed and inadequate, suggesting a reluctance to seek help due to stigma or lack of awareness about resources.
- **Inconsistency**: Some students report taking positive actions like engaging in hobbies, yet their emotional state remains negative (e.g., feeling isolated or anxious), indicating these coping mechanisms may not be effective.
- **Key Observation**: The frequent mention of "feeling disconnected from studies" and "comparing yourself to others" in both thoughts and actions highlights a deeper issue of misalignment between personal goals and academic pursuits, contributing to anxiety.

This empathy map underscores the need for better mental health support, clearer academic expectations, and fostering a sense of belonging to alleviate student anxiety.
