# Personification: Anvi, the Overwhelmed RVCE MCA Student

## Character Description
Meet **Anvi**, a 22-year-old MCA student at RVCE. Anvi isn’t just a person—she’s the living embodiment of the anxiety that grips many students in her program. She has a restless energy, with eyes that dart nervously as if scanning for the next deadline or expectation. Her shoulders are perpetually hunched under the weight of her backpack, stuffed with textbooks, unopened emails, and unspoken worries. Anvi’s voice wavers between determination and doubt, reflecting the constant tug-of-war between her ambitions and her fears.

## Narrative: Anvi’s Story
Anvi wakes up each morning with a knot in her chest, her heart racing before her feet even hit the floor. “Another day of deadlines,” she mutters, glancing at her phone, where notifications from faculty and classmates pile up like unpaid bills. She drags herself to class, her mind buzzing with thoughts: *“Will I ever catch up? What if I fail this semester? Everyone else seems to have it together—why don’t I?”* The lecture hall feels like a pressure cooker, with professors tossing out vague instructions and expectations that seem impossible to meet. Anvi scribbles notes furiously, but her thoughts wander to her family’s hopes back home and the loans piling up for her education.

By afternoon, Anvi’s anxiety manifests physically—her breath grows shallow, and sleep feels like a distant memory. She compares her progress to her classmates, who seem to breeze through coding assignments while she’s stuck debugging her self-confidence. “Maybe I don’t belong here,” she thinks, her inner voice sharp with self-doubt. To cope, Anvi retreats to her hostel room, curling up under her blanket to escape the world. Sometimes, she texts a friend or scrolls through social media, hoping for a distraction, but the relief is fleeting. Hobbies like sketching or going for a run cross her mind, but she sighs, “Who has time for that?”

At night, Anvi lies awake, wrestling with a nagging question: *“Should I get help?”* She’s heard about campus counseling but hesitates. “What if it’s not serious enough? What if they think I’m weak?” she worries. She recalls a classmate mentioning therapy but dismisses it, convincing herself she can handle it alone. “I’ll figure it out,” she whispers, though the words feel hollow. Deep down, Anvi craves clarity—clear feedback from her professors, a sense of belonging among her peers, and a future that doesn’t feel so uncertain. But for now, she’s stuck in a loop, battling her anxiety with avoidance and hoping tomorrow will be different.

A workshop on time management could ease her deadlines. A peer support group could make her feel less alone. A counselor who understands her cultural context could help her name her anxiety and face it.
